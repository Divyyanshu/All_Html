          In summary, JavaScript is a unique programming language primarily used
          for web development, both on the client and server sides. While it has
          its strengths, it's essential to choose the right language for the
          specific use case. Other programming languages like Python, Java, and
          Ruby have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends
          on the project's requirements and constraint.

Use Cases:

            JavaScript: Mainly used for web development (front-end and back-end) and increasingly in other domains like game development (using frameworks like Phaser).
            Ruby: Commonly used for web development (Ruby on Rails), scripting, and automation.
            Strengths:
            
            JavaScript: Well-suited for building modern web applications with rich user interfaces. Has a large and active developer community.
            Ruby: Known for its elegant and human-readable syntax, which can lead to rapid development. Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework.
            Weaknesses:
            
            JavaScript: Can have challenges with asynchronous programming and can be error-prone if not used carefully.
            Ruby: Not as performant as some other languages, which may be a concern for high-traffic websites.</pre
